# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
Confident. It feels straightforward to me. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Confident.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements? Confident, I found these activities in particular to be fun. 
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? 30 minutes maybe? It was a little shorter than I thought, but I still might come back and do the spicy challenge. 
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I just need to complete the tasks for tomorrow, and I think I have plenty of time for that. 
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? 
I read the hard question, so I will probably have to do that one just so I can find out how to solve it.
